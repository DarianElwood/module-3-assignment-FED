# Reflection

Overall, I found that this project was quite straightforward. Practically all of the challenges presented I have faceed beforehand. However, I believe that there may be a better implementation of the way state is handled, as it seems a bit clunky to track state through a single variable. 

I am rather proud of the way I structured the navigation system, as it is very easy to add new content to the story by simply adding new objects to the story array. I felt that this was the most efficient way to handle the story content, as it allows for easy expansion and modification. This also made it easy for me to implement the state management system, as I could simply reference the id of the current state to retrieve the relevant content.
