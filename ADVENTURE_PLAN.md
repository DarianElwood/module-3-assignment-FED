# Adventure Game Plan

## Overview

My adventure game is a text-based "choose your own adventure" where a player navigates through a series of choices after waking up in a field with no memory of how they got there. 

## Game Structure

The player plays as an advisor for Echo Squad, a team of special operatives operating within a military grey zone. It is their job to make decisions that will lead the team to success or failure. 

The team was deployed in the area to perform reconnaissance missions on nearby high-value targets. However, soon after arriving, new intel came in that a rebel offensive was likely to occur in the area. The player must navigate the team through a series of choices to ensure the team's safety and the success of their mission.

## Choice 1: Fortify a secure position and secure the area or move to a new location to avoid detection?

- **Fortify Position**: The team sets up a secure perimeter and successfully defends against an initial rebel attack. A soldier is injured during the skirmish but remains stable.
    - **Next Choice**: Begin medical treatment on-site or organize an immediate medevac?
        - **Medical Evacuation**: The team calls for a medevac, but the medevac alerts the rebels to their position, leading to a larger attack. The team survives but suffers casualties. Their combat effectiveness is reduced severely. 
            - **Next Choice**: Attempt to hold position or retreat to a safer location?
                - **Hold Position**: The team holds their ground but is eventually overrun due to reduced numbers and effectiveness. The mission fails.
                - **Retreat**: The team successfully retreats to a safer location, but the mission is compromised, and they must regroup and plan a new approach.
        - **Treat On-Site**: The team treats the injured soldier on-site, the rebel offensive never occurs, and the team remains intact.
            - **Next Choice**: Begin patrol missions in surrounding area or set up a more defensible base?
                - **Patrol Missions**: The team conducts successful patrols, leading to the apprehension of a high value target. The mission is a huge success.
                - **Defensible Base**: The team fortifies their position further, but the lack of movement leads to boredom and lowered morale. The mission is a moderate success.

- **Move to New Location**: The team decides to move to a new location, successfully avoiding detection. However, during the move, they encounter a rebel patrol.
    - **Next Choice**: Engage the patrol or attempt to sneak past?
        - **Engage Patrol**: The team engages the patrol, successfully eliminating the threat, whilst also suffering no casualties. 
            - **Next Choice**: Continue moving to a new location or set up a temporary camp?
                - **New Location**: The team moves to a new location, but the constant movement leads to fatigue and lowered morale. The mission is a moderate success.
                - **Temporary Camp**: The team sets up a temporary camp, allowing them to rest and recover. 
                    - **Next Choice**: Conduct reconnaissance missions in surrounding area or fortify the camp?
                        - **Reconnaissance Missions**: The rebel activity in the area is less than expected, no valuable intel is gathered. The mission is a minor success.
                        - **Fortify Camp**: The team fortifies their camp, leading to a successful defense against a rebel attack. The mission is a huge success, only suffering minor injuries.
        - **Sneak Past**: The team attempts to sneak past the patrol but is detected. A firefight ensues, resulting in casualties on both sides. The team suffers significant losses, and the mission is compromised.
            - **Next Choice**: Attempt to regroup and continue the mission or retreat to a safer location?
                - **Regroup**: The team regroups and continues the mission, but the loss of personnel and morale leads to a failed mission.
                - **Retreat**: The team successfully retreats to a safer location, but the mission is compromised, and they must regroup and plan a new approach.

- **Attempt to Contact Local Allies**: The team attempts to contact local allies for support, and contact is made with a local militia group.
    - **Next Choice**: There is no solid intel on the militia's loyalties. Do you want to request their assistance or decline and continue the mission alone?
        - **Request Assistance**: The local militia agrees to provide support, leading to a successful joint operation against the rebels. 
            - **Next Choice**: The local allies purport to have knowledge of a high value target in the area. However, this intelligence is unverified. Do you want to pursue this lead or focus on the current mission?
                - **Pursue Lead**: The team pursues the lead, but it turns out to be a trap set by the rebels. The team suffers heavy casualties, and the mission fails.
                - **Focus on Current Mission**: The team focuses on the current mission, leading to a successful operation against the rebels. The mission is a huge success.
        - **Decline Assistance**: The team declines the assistance, leading to a successful mission but with higher casualties than if they had accepted the help. The mission is a moderate success.
            - **Next Choice**: After the mission, do you want to establish a permanent base in the area or extract and return to base?
                - **Establish Base**: The team establishes a permanent base, leading to increased control over the area and successful future operations. The mission is a huge success.
                - **Extract**: The team extracts and returns to base, leading to a successful debrief and planning for future missions. The mission is a minor success.
